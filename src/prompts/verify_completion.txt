Let's verify that all tasks have been completed properly:

1. Check CHECKLIST.json to confirm all tasks are marked as "completed"
2. Verify that all code follows TypeScript and OOP principles
3. Ensure all files are clean, short, and follow industry standards
4. Test that all functionality works as expected

If anything is incomplete, please finish it before we wrap up this workflow.
