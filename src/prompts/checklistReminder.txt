I see that the CHECKLIST.json file hasn't been created yet. Please create this file in the workspace root with the following structure:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Task name",
      "description": "Detailed task description",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each task from my input should be added as an entry in the "tasks" array. This file is needed before we can proceed with the workflow.
