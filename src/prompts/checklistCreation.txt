I need you to create a structured checklist from the following user tasks:

$TASKS$

Please:
1. Analyze these tasks and break them down into subtasks where appropriate
2. Create a file named "CHECKLIST.json" in the workspace root directory
3. Organize the tasks in this JSON structure:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Task title",
      "description": "Detailed task description",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

This file will be used to track progress throughout our development workflow. Please create this file directly in the workspace root - do not just include it in your response.
