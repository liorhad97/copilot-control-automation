# Git Branch Creation

Please create a new Git branch for the current task using the following naming conventions:

- For features: `feature/descriptive-name`
- For bug fixes: `bugfix/issue-description`
- For improvements: `improvement/description`
- For refactoring: `refactor/component-name`

The branch name should be concise but descriptive of the work being done. Use kebab-case for multi-word descriptions.

Once you've created and checked out the branch, please confirm by showing the output of `git branch` or similar command that indicates the current active branch.
