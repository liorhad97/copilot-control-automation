The CHECKLIST.json file at ${FILE_PATH} has an invalid structure. Please update it to follow this format:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Task name",
      "description": "Detailed task description",
      "status": "pending"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each task needs these exact fields: id (number), name (string), description (string), and status (string). Please fix the file structure directly.
