# Continue Development Iteration

Let's continue with the next iteration of development. Please review what has been accomplished so far and focus on the remaining items:

1. Review your previous changes and ensure they are working correctly
2. Address any unresolved issues or incomplete items from the checklist
3. Implement the next logical set of features or improvements
4. Continue to follow best practices and maintain code quality

If you've already completed all the originally requested work, focus on:
- Refinements and optimizations
- Additional test coverage
- Improved error handling
- Documentation improvements

Please confirm you understand what needs to be done in this iteration and outline your plan for proceeding.
