# Write Tests

Please write tests for the code you've implemented. Follow these guidelines:

1. Create comprehensive test coverage for all new functionality
2. Include both positive tests (expected behavior) and negative tests (error handling)
3. Use the existing testing framework and follow established patterns in the codebase
4. Test edge cases and potential failure scenarios
5. Ensure tests are descriptive and clearly indicate what is being tested
6. Verify that all tests pass before considering the implementation complete

If you encounter any test failures, please fix the underlying issues in the implementation.

When complete, provide a summary of the test coverage and any insights gained from the testing process.
