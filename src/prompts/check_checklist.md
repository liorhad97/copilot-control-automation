# Checklist Verification

Let's review the development checklist to see what's been completed and what remains:

Please go through each item on the checklist and mark it as completed or in progress. For any incomplete items, please provide a brief explanation of what remains to be done.

If all items are complete, please provide a final summary of the feature implementation including:

1. Key components implemented
2. How the implementation meets the requirements
3. Any notable design decisions
4. Recommendations for potential future improvements

This information will help determine if we need another iteration or if the feature is ready for review.
